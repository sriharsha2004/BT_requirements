1. Stash Your Local Changes (optional, but safer):
Before pulling the changes, it's a good idea to stash your changes so that you don’t lose anything.

git stash
This will temporarily save your local changes in a "stash" so you can apply them later.
2. Pull the Latest Changes from the Remote Repository:
Now that your changes are stashed, you can safely pull the changes made by the other person.

git pull
This should fetch the latest updates from the remote and merge them into your local branch.
3. Apply Your Stashed Changes:
Now, you can reapply your local changes on top of the newly pulled changes.

git stash pop
At this point, there could still be conflicts between your changes and the ones pulled from the remote. Git will mark the conflicting files and ask you to resolve them.
4. Resolve Merge Conflicts:
Open the conflicting files. Git will mark the conflicting parts with special markers like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes here
=======
Other person’s changes here
>>>>>>> [commit hash]
You need to manually edit the files to keep the changes you want and remove the markers.
After resolving the conflicts, save the files.
5. Stage the Resolved Files:
Once you've resolved the conflicts, stage the files for commit.

git add <filename>
or if you’ve resolved all conflicts:


git add .
6. Commit the Changes:
Commit the merge resolution.


git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and merged changes from remote"
7. Push Your Changes (if needed):
Finally, if everything looks good and you want to push the changes to the remote repository:

git push
That should merge both sets of changes and allow you to move forward without losing any work! Would you like more details on any of the steps?





If faced Issue while pushing :


Option 1: Rebase (Recommended for a cleaner history)
Rebasing will apply your local commit on top of the remote commits, keeping a cleaner, linear history.
	1. First, ensure you have the latest remote changes:
	2. git fetch
	3. Rebase your local changes onto the remote branch:

git rebase origin/Harsha

During the rebase process, if there are conflicts, Git will stop and allow you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase:
	git rebase --continue
	4. Once the rebase is complete, push your changes:

git push

NOTE : To review changes made at the gitswarm , close that and open that again
