Testing_go_packages.txt

*.test files are used for testing
To run these files use : go test 
This command will automatically run all methods in the *.test files , which start with Test
 
 
If we want to execute methods  automatically when we run go test 
We should start methods with Test , eg: TestmethodName() 
And should take one and only argument : t *testing.T 
Should not return any values
All the methods with this will execute
And also the method name after Test keyword should start with a capital letter : 
Eg: Testsetup is a wrong test method , TestSetup is a valid test method
 
 
If we do not follow above rules , those methods will not be treated as test methods , and those will not be executed when we run :
go test
